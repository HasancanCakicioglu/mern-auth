# MERN Authentication Backend Project

This project is a full-stack web application built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It provides user authentication functionality, allowing users to sign up, sign in, and access protected routes using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

## Features

- User registration (Sign Up)
- User authentication (Sign In)
- Access control with JWT
- Protected routes for authenticated users
- Password hashing with bcrypt.js
- MongoDB database integration with Mongoose ODM

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing user data.
- Express.js: A backend web application framework for Node.js.
- React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment for executing server-side code.
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens): A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.
- bcrypt.js: A library to help hash passwords securely.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HasancanCakicioglu/mern-auth.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd mern-auth
   ```

3. Install dependencies for the backend:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:

   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Define the following environment variables:
     ```
     MONGODB_URI=<your_mongodb_uri>
     JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret>
     PORT=<your_port>
     ```

5. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- Register a new user by providing a username, email, and password.
- Sign in with your registered email and password to access protected routes.
- After signing in, you'll receive a JWT token, which you can use to access protected routes.
- Access protected routes by including the JWT token in the request headers (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <token>`).
